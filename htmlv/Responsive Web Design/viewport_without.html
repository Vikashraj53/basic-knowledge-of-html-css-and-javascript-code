    <p>
        The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 
        As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated 
        to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, 
        with most populations living in small isolated pockets. 
        India currently hosts the largest tiger population. 
        Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction,
        habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims 
        of humanâ€“wildlife conflict, due to encroachment in countries 
        with a high human population density.
