        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living 
        cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
        It is most recognisable for its dark vertical 
        stripes on orange fur with a white underside. 
        An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, 
        such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and 
        generally a solitary but social predator, requiring 
        large contiguous areas of habitat to support its 
        requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. 
        Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years 
        and then become independent, leaving their mother's 
        home range to establish their own.
