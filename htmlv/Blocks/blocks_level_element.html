        <h2>Tiger</h2>
        <p>
            Easily recognized by its coat of reddish-orange 
            with dark stripes, the tiger is the largest wild 
            cat in the world. The big cat's tail is three feet long. 
            On average the big cat weighs 450 pounds, 
            about the same as eight ten-year-old kids. 
            It stands three feet tall with teeth four inches 
            long and claws as long as house keys.

        <h2>Lion</h2>
        <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus 
            Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
            broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; 
            and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually 
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females 
            and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, 
            forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists 
            of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, 
            preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an 
            apex and keystone predator; although some lions 
            scavenge when opportunities occur and have been 
            known to hunt humans, lions typically do not 
            actively seek out and prey on humans.
