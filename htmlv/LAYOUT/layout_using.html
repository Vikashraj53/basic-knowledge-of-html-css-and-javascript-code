    <h2>Tiger</h2>
    <p>
        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living 
        cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
        It is most recognisable for its dark vertical 
        stripes on orange fur with a white underside. 
        An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, 
        such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and 
        generally a solitary but social predator, requiring 
        large contiguous areas of habitat to support its 
        requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. 
        Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years 
        and then become independent, leaving their mother's 
        home range to establish their own.
        <p>
            The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. 
            It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region 
            in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and 
            in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to 
            Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, 
            tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their 
            historic range and have been extirpated from Western 
            and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and 
            in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. 
            What remains of the range where tigers still roam free 
            is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian 
            temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests 
            on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single 
            Indonesian island, Sumatra.
